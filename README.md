## Overview
Siege Breaker is a tower defense game where the player must construct and upgrade towers to defend against waves of incoming enemies.

## Gameplay
Players must survive as many enemy waves as possible in order to unlock items and progress through the game. Towers must be built on 'hardpoints' and will attack any enemies in range. Enemies will spawn at the Portal and move along a set path towards the Nexus. If an enemy reaches the Nexus, the Nexus will take damage. The level is over when the Nexus reaches zero health. Enemies can also damage nearby towers while moving towards the Nexus. If a tower loses all of its health, it will be destroyed and unable to attack. At the end of the wave, all destroyed towers are revived.

## Towers
There are 6 unique towers, each with different damage, health, and range.

* **Fireball:** Summon a fireball that explodes on impact, damaging nearby enemies.
* **Frostbite:** Conjure a shard of ice that deals damage and Slows the enemy.
* **Arcane Bolt:** Strike an enemy with an bolt of arcane lightning.
* **Plasma Ring:** Releases a ring of plasma centered on the tower that expands outward, damaging all enemies on its path.
* **Incineration:** Incinerates all enemies in a cone infront of the tower, continuously dealing damage.
* **Void Ray:** Gains bonus damage the longer it targets the same enemy.

## Upgrades
Each tower has 6 unique upgrades (known as 'Essences' in-game) which can effect its capabilities. The following are example upgrades:
* **Fireball - Immolation:** Each fireball has a 30% chance to inflict 5 damage to this tower but gain 100% damage and 30% explosion size.
* **Frostbite - Ice Barrier:** When this tower is reduced below 50% health, it will gain Damage Immunity for 3 seconds. This effect can only occur once per wave.
* **Arcane Bolt - Lifebloom:** If this tower is Destroyed, it will heal all other towers in Range for 5% of its maximum health every 3 seconds.
* **Plasma Ring - Resonance:** Enemy attacks against this tower have a 10% chance to release a plasma ring.
* **Incineration - Superheated:** Gain 5% bonus damage per second while attacking, up to 50%. This bonus damage is reduced by 5% per second while not attacking.
* **Void Ray - Soul Siphon:** This tower's attacks have a 20% chance to steal 1 Damage from the enemy for 6 seconds.

A tower can have up to 3 upgrades active at one time. Upgrades can be permanently strengthened to improve their effect.

## Resources
There are several items players must acquire to progress.
* **Orb of Scrying:** Reveals 3 random unlearned upgrades to player. The player selects 1 to learn.
* **Anima Shard:** Provides a random amount of Anima when harvested. Anima is used to augment the Nexus.
* **Minerals:** There are 4 minerals: Green, Blue, Purple, and Gold. They are used to strengthen upgrades and are mined by towers at the end of each wave.
